# Search for objects game
A simple game that I suddenly wanted to make.


Use the mouse to move around the map.
Avoid dangerous **mines** and collect all **objects** as quickly as possible.

But remember - the **fog of war** will hide from your eyes what was visible before.


Actually, don't expect much, it's just circles and squares. :)
